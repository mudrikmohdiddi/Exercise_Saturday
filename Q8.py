'''8. (Car-Pool Savings Calculator) Research several car-pooling websites. Create an application
that calculates your daily driving cost, so that you can estimate how much money could be 
saved by car pooling, which also has other advantages such as reducing carbon emissions 
and reducing traffic congestion. The application should input the following information and 
display the userâ€™s cost per day of driving to work: 
a) Total miles driven per day.
b) Cost per gallon of gasoline.
c) Parking fees per day.
d) Average miles per gallon
e) Tolls per day'''
